    <p>
      I am an Exercise and Sport Science and Psychology major with a strong interest in 
      pediatric occupational therapy. I currently work with a nonprofit that provides free 
      dance classes for differently abled children, and this experience has shaped my passion 
      for creating supportive, inclusive spaces for kids. Working with kids in this setting shows me the power of patience, connection, and accessible support and how much it can affect a child.
    </p>

    <p>
      In the future, I hope to become an occupational therapist specializing in children with 
      disabilities and eventually start my own nonprofit that expands access to therapy and 
      resources for low-income families. My long-term goal is to make sure every child, regardless 
      of background or ability, has the support and opportunities they deserve.
